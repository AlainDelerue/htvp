-----------------
 MAIN PRINCIPLES
-----------------
The tool "htvp.exe" needs to be running on the slave's PC (It doesn't show any window and it doesn't show any icon in the notification area).
The aim of the tool is to complete some tasks for you. Therefore you need to be able to send it some commands and to receive the results if any.

There are two ways of sending commands to the tool:

1) Using your keyboard
----------------------
You just have to enter the command using your keyboard. It works only from a remote keyboard: if the slave type these commands using his local leyboard, they won't work.
Important remarks:
- Make sure your entry focus is in the slave's PC when you enter the command.
- Do not use any Backspace, Supp, Arrows in the middle of the command: It needs to be the right key sequence.
- If your entry focus is in a Notepad the sub will see your typing, if your entry focus is on his desktop, he won't see anything which may be better :-)

Example: "tvh" is the command to hide the TV Panel, therefore, if you type "Hello SlavehtpHow are you?" the TV Panel disapears exactly when you type the "p" just before the "How..."

All the keybload commands start with "tv" which is the prefix for keyboard commands.

In order to avoid wrong command detection in normal writting like in chat, the commands have been chosen to not be found in normal English: for instance the command "ell" wouldn't be ok because you don't want "hello" to trigger a command! :-)

Because these commands are to be typed like in a "blind mode" (for instance when your entry focus is in the slave's desktop there is no echo when you type a character), the commands have to be very short and without any parameters.

List of available Keyboard commands as of today (feel free to ask for more :-) ):
tvh	--> Hides the TV Panel
tvs	--> Shows the TV Panel
tvch	--> Hides the TV Computer list
tvcs	--> Shows the TV Computer list
tvnk	--> Freezes the slave's keyboard (Warning: It remains frozen as long as the tool is running, even if you disconnect and even if he uses CTRL+ALT+DEL)
tvk	--> Releases the slave's keyboard
tvexit	--> Stops the tool (Then everything comes back to normal for the slave and you need to relaunch the tool if you want to get its features back)

2) Using the clipboard
----------------------
You just have to select and copy the command... and that's it! No need to past them anywhere, only copy to put them in the clipboard. When i got this idea i was very excited :-)
You built all the commands you need in a notepad document and then, as soon as you copy the commands you want, the tool executes them!
That way, it is very easy to launch enhanced commands with required parameters.
Moreover, in case you command gives a result, the result is delivered in the clipboard: then simply "past" in a blank notepad document and you get the result!
In order to avoid the slave to discover the command as well as the result:
- the clipboard is erased as soon as the tool reads the command
- the result is kept for 30 seconds in the clipboard, then it is erased.









If it is launched as Administrator, it will be able to perform admin tasks, otherwise it will be onli
